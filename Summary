Aviation Analytics And Prediction

This is a final project that I worked upon using AWS along with Machine Learning using the Decision Tree Classifier on the data and 
then using the created model to further make predictions on the new data.

First download the data using Hadoop for the year 2000 containing flight data and then using Hive create the tables and finally one this is done,
get the records into your system locally.

Once the file is in our local system, load that and apply the ML algorithm after performing EDA and data engineering to get the best results.
